# ESP8266 Google Gemini AI Client

This project turns your **ESP8266** microcontroller into a text-based AI client. It connects to the **Google Gemini API** (specifically the `gemini-1.5-flash` model), allowing you to type questions into the Arduino Serial Monitor and receive intelligent responses generated by the AI.

## 📋 Features

  * **Direct API Access:** Connects directly to Google's Generative Language API without intermediate servers.
  * **Interactive Chat:** Takes user input via the Serial Monitor.
  * **JSON Parsing:** Utilizes the `ArduinoJson` library to robustly handle complex API responses.
  * **Auto-Recovery:** Automatically restarts the board if the Wi-Fi connection fails during startup.
  * **Timeout Logic:** Waits 30 seconds for user input before looping to prevent idle blocking.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

  * **ESP8266 Board:** (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, ESP-01).
  * **Micro USB Cable:** For serial communication and power.

## 💻 Software Prerequisites

1.  **Arduino IDE** installed.
2.  **ESP8266 Board Manager** installed.
3.  **ArduinoJson Library**:
      * Go to **Sketch \> Include Library \> Manage Libraries**.
      * Search for `ArduinoJson`.
      * Install the latest version (Version 6.x or 7.x).

## 🔑 Getting a Gemini API Key

To use this code, you need a free API key from Google:

1.  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Log in with your Google account.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"**.
4.  Copy the key string.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Open the `.ino` file and update the following variables at the top of the script:

```cpp
// Wi-Fi Configuration
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";        
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"; 

// OpenAI Gemini API Configuration
const char* Gemini_Token = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"; // Paste your key here
const char* Gemini_Max_Tokens = "400";            // Limit response length to save RAM
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Connect your ESP8266 to your PC.
2.  Select the correct Board and Port in Arduino IDE.
3.  Upload the code.
4.  Open the **Serial Monitor** (Ctrl+Shift+M).
5.  **Important:** Set the baud rate to **115200** and the line ending to **Newline** or **Both NL & CR**.

## 📝 Usage

1.  Once connected, the Serial Monitor will prompt: `Ask your Question:`.
2.  Type your question into the input field at the top of the Serial Monitor and press **Enter**.
3.  The ESP8266 will send the request to Google servers.
4.  After a few seconds, the AI's answer will appear in the console.

## 📊 Sample Output

```text
Connecting to Wi-Fi: MyHomeWiFi
..
Connected to Wi-Fi!
IP address: 192.168.1.20

Ask your Question:
Asking Your Question: "What is the capital of France?"

Here is your Answer:
The capital of France is Paris.
```

## ⚠️ Limitations & Notes

  * **Memory Constraints:** The ESP8266 has limited RAM. If the AI generates a very long response, the JSON parsing might fail or the board might crash. Keep `Gemini_Max_Tokens` around 400-500.
  * **HTTPS Security:** The code uses `client.setInsecure()`. This is standard for hobbyist ESP8266 projects to avoid managing complex SSL certificates, but it means the connection is not verified against a root CA.
  * **Input Handling:** The code waits 30 seconds for input. If you don't type anything, it will loop and ask again.
